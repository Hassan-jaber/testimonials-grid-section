            ‚Äú I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I‚Äôve
            been looking to make a <br />
            transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience
            here. I signed up <br />
            for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled
            shortly thereafter.<br />
            The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my
            life. Since completing<br />
            the course, I‚Äôve successfully switched careers, working as a
            Software Engineer at a VR startup. ‚Äù

            ‚Äú Before joining the bootcamp, I‚Äôve <br />
            never written a line of code. I needed <br />
            some structure from professionals <br />
            who can help me learn programming <br />
            step by step. I was encouraged to <br />
            enroll by a former student of theirs <br />
            who can only say wonderful things <br />
            about the program. The entire <br />
            curriculum and staff did not <br />
            disappoint. They were very hands-on <br />
            and I never had to wait long for <br />
            assistance. The agile team project, in <br />
            particular, was outstanding. It took <br />
            my learning to the next level in a way <br />
            that no tutorial could ever have. In <br />
            fact, I‚Äôve often referred to it during <br />
            interviews as an example of my <br />
            developent experience. It certainly <br />
            helped me land a job as a full-stack <br />
            developer after receiving multiple <br />
            offers. 100% recommend! ‚Äù
